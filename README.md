## <ins>Phindr3D</ins>

Phindr3D a comprehensive shallow-learning framework for automated quantitative phenotyping of three-dimensional (3D) image data; using unsupervised data-driven voxel-based feature learning, which enables computationally facile classification, clustering and data visualization

### <ins>Citation</ins>

Mergenthaler P, Hariharan S, Pemberton JM, Lourenco C, Penn LZ, Andrews DW (2021) Rapid 3D phenotypic analysis of neurons and organoids using data-driven cell segmentation-free machine learning. PLoS Comput Biol 17(2): e1008630. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008630

### <ins>Installation</ins>

The code is written using Matlab 64 bit version 2017b. Download the repository and add it to your Matlab path.

#### Depndencies

Download the Matlab drtoolbox from [here](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/) and add to your Matlab path. For affinity propagation, the Matlab code is already available as part of the package (under Third Party)

### <ins>3D Data Sets</ins>

The full datasets for 3D microscopy data sets generated in this study were deposited to the Open Microscopy Image Data Resource repository (http://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession number idr0105.

Test image data sets with an excerpt of the neuron and organoid data that will allow quick evaluation of the core features of Phindr3D were deposited to the open science platform Zenodo (https://zenodo.org; neuron data: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4064148 [https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4064148]; MCF10 organoid data: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4384912 [https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4384912]). Numerical data for the figure panels were deposited to Zenodo (https://zenodo.org; DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4385040 [https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4385040])
